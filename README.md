Welcome to the documentation for our Full Stack Bike Rental Website built with Next.js 13. This project incorporates a powerful stack to deliver a seamless and efficient bike rental experience. Below, you'll find detailed information on the technologies used, installation instructions, and other relevant details to get you started.

## Technologies Used

1. **Next.js 13:** The foundation of our project, providing a powerful and flexible framework for building React applications with server-side rendering.

2. **React:** A declarative and efficient JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Used extensively throughout the project to create dynamic and responsive components.

3. **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that simplifies the process of styling our components. It ensures a consistent and visually appealing design across the entire application.

4. **Prisma:** A modern database toolkit that simplifies database access in our Next.js application. It enables us to interact with the database seamlessly using a type-safe query builder.

5. **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used to store and manage our application's data efficiently. Prisma handles the communication between Next.js and MongoDB.

6. **NextAuth 2023:** A complete authentication solution for Next.js applications, providing secure and customizable authentication flows.
